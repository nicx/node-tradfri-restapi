# Node TRÃ…DFRI REST-API [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-tradfri-restapi.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-tradfri-restapi)

What
---
A simple REST-API implementation of [node-tradfri-argon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-tradfri-argon) with the following commands

 - `/tradfri/deviceids` will provide an array of device ids
 - `/tradfri/groupids` will provide an array of group ids
 - `/tradfri/devices` will provide a full list of all devices including meta data
 - `/tradfri/groups` will provide a full list of all groups including devices id's and meta data
 - `/tradfri/all` will provide a full detailed list of groups and devices
 - `/tradfri/device/:deviceid/:state` will set the state of a device (on/off). E.g. /tradfri/device/17101/on
 - `/tradfri/group/:groupid/:state` will set the state of a device (on/off). E.g. /tradfri/device/11007/off
 - `/tradfri/register` will provide a PSK for defined client

First release is a bit of a quick one. Exceptions needs to be managed and include toggle as an option.
